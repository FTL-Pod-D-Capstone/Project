Successfully able to navigate pages with JWT, GeoCoding with GoogleMapsAPI, Completed the MVP for the Friday presentation.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 The OpenAI chatbot, saving the conversation and the tailoring the bot to our website. GoogleMapsAPI, specifically the GeoCoding to populate with pins.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we're able to finish all the required MVP core features and tasks this week. While we accomplished this, we are still going to prioritize other desried core features along with CSS to polish the look of the website and its features.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, the CodePath instructors were very helpful and useful as we asked many debuging and API questions. Specifically, the instructors walk around and message us on slack to check in and make sure we're keeping up.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 As of now, no features or stories are "at risk." Stretch features may be placed "at risk" due to time and the feature's ability to serve the web app.
