## Reflection Questions

Successfully applied CSS to the Organization: Calendar and Schedule pages, Recieved and applied feedback from mentor pod sync, delivered great presentation.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 The OpenAI chatbot and deloying the website to live render, there were AWS S3 Bucket issues which had affected our deployment.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished most of our tasks which consisted of bugs and minor issues. We are still working on the website's responsiveness and its ability to be displayed on mobile and smaller screens

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, the CodePath instructors had been on top of their game, offering a helping hand and other resources whenever we requested. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 No features are at risk, if anything, the responsiveness would be our main priority to be implemented.
