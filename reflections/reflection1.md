## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 -Successful Things: 1) Progress of the core features, 2) Creation of the DB and backend CRUD, 3) Implementing APIs into our app

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 -Some of the of the challenges faced was integrating APIs: it's authentication and access tokens. Applying the MaterialUI library was also a challenge as the components that are needed/downloaded each have complex CSS capabilities.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 -We we're able to complete all our sprint plans for this week. While some of the APIs implemented still need to be tweaked, they are existing in the app.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 -We mainly used the help of the CodePath instructors, Devarsh, Alex, Erica. They really helped us a lot when it came to planning, debugging and receiving feedback about our app and progress.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 -No core features are "at risk." Instead, depending on our sprint planning some stretch features may be placed "at risk" due to time and the feature's ability to serve the web app.
